                My website will be about the best golf clubs to buy for each catergory depending on your skill level.
            </li>
            <li>
                The objective is to give golfers of all levels the knowledge they need to know when looking to buying new golf clubs right off the shop, and does not want to spend the extra money to get fitted.
            </li>
            <li>
                My target audience are golfers who are not looking to get a serious fitting for a golf club; and is rather looking to buy something straight off the shelf.
            </li>
            <li>
                I plan to create pages for each different type of club that goes into a golfing set. Within each page I will catergorize clubs into Beginner (20+ handicap), Amaetuer (10-19 handicap), Experienced (0-9 handicap). With each level I will show case atleast 3 different club options that people could choose from. A bonus club will be featured in each page as well.
